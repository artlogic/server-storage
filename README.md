server-storage
==============

 A RESTful reimplementation of localStorage using Express and MongoDB.

TODO
----

* Tests - grunt/gulp?
* Add a bit of documentation for the server side API... the client lib should just need to be included as it matches the w3 storage spec.
* Fix the hardcoded base in client.js
