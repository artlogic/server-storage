server-storage
==============

 A RESTful reimplementation of localStorage using Express and MongoDB.

TODO
----

* Tests - grunt/gulp?
* Do we need to clean up this up a bit more? Better structure?
* Add a bit of documentation for the server side API... the client lib should just need to be included.
